Starter repo for my fantasy football analytics and Power BI workflows.

## Project layout

- `notebooks/` – exploration & experiments
- `src/fantasyfootball/` – reusable Python code (ETL, features, viz)
- `powerbi/` – PBIP project (Git-friendly) and exports
- `tests/` – unit tests
- `reports/` – figures and outputs
